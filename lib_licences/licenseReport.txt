Gson (2.8.9) - Apache-2.0

      Guava InternalFutureFailureAccess and InternalFutures (1.0.1) - The Apache Software License, Version 2.0
      Contains
com.google.common.util.concurrent.internal.InternalFutureFailureAccess and
InternalFutures. Most users will never need to use this artifact. Its
classes is conceptually a part of Guava, but they're in this separate
artifact so that Android libraries can use them without pulling in all of
Guava (just as they can use ListenableFuture by depending on the
listenablefuture artifact).

      Guava ListenableFuture only (9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava) - The Apache Software License, Version 2.0
      An empty artifact that Guava depends on to signal that it is providing
ListenableFuture -- but is also available in a second "version" that
contains com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture class, without
any other Guava classes. The idea is:

- If users want only ListenableFuture, they depend on listenablefuture-1.0.

- If users want all of Guava, they depend on guava, which, as of Guava
27.0, depends on
listenablefuture-9999.0-empty-to-avoid-conflict-with-guava. The 9999.0-...
version number is enough for some build systems (notably, Gradle) to select
that empty artifact over the "real" listenablefuture-1.0 -- avoiding a
conflict with the copy of ListenableFuture in guava itself. If users are
using an older version of Guava or a build system other than Gradle, they
may see class conflicts. If so, they can solve them by manually excluding
the listenablefuture artifact or manually forcing their build systems to
use 9999.0-....

        StringTemplate 4 (4.3)
        StringTemplate is a java template engine for generating source code,
web pages, emails, or any other formatted text output.

StringTemplate is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators,
multiple site skins, and internationalization/localization.

It evolved over years of effort developing jGuru.com.

StringTemplate also powers the ANTLR 3 and 4 code generator. Its distinguishing characteristic
is that unlike other engines, it strictly enforces model-view separation.

Strict separation makes websites and code generators more flexible
and maintainable; it also provides an excellent defense against malicious
template authors.
